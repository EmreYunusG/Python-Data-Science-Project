# Python-Data-Science-Project

The "Python Project for Data Science" course is completed on Coursera, where Python programming is applied to solve real-world data science problems. The project involved tasks like data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using popular libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly. This hands-on experience improved my understanding of Python's practical applications in data-driven projects. The project's codes can be found on my Github account.
